# Lab report #1

I made a scatter plot with x = TotalLivingArea and y = Sale Price.
But, it was incredibly zoomed out so I limited the cartesian coordinate range.
There seems to be a positive correlation between Total Living Area and Sale Price based on the graph,
although I would probably have to make a correlation matrix to confirm.
